## How to Start the Project

### 1. Generate a Secret Key
First, you need to generate a secret key to secure your application. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python -c "import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(64))"
```

This command will generate a random secret key. Copy the output and add it to your `.env` file in the format `SECRET_KEY=your_generated_key`. Itâ€™s important to keep this key confidential and not to share it with others.

### 2. Configure the `.env` File
If you don't already have a `.env` file in the root directory of your project, create one. Add the generated secret key and any other necessary configuration settings (like database credentials).

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_key
# Other configuration settings
```

### 3. Start Docker Containers
If your project uses Docker, you can start the containers by running the `make up` command. Make sure this command is configured in your `Makefile` to bring up all required services.

```shell
make up
```

### 4. Access the Project
Once the containers are running, you can access your project at the following local address:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Open this address in a browser to verify that your project is running.

After completing these steps, your project should be ready to go!
